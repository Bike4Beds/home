<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">For Matt Ritz, the experience of nature and the joy of the moment is a very important part of life.  He spends his free time biking, running, snowboarding and hiking; indulging in the outdoors and maintaining and active lifestyle.  A few years ago, Matt found a way to bring these exhilarating activities and pleasant, scenic rides to others by creating the Bike4Beds organization.</font></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">The first bike ride for charity took root during the fall of 2008 when Matt’s niece Akoua joined the Peace Corps in Lesotho to combat the AIDS proliferation in that area.  Akoua made her extended family aware of the need for assistance for the hospital where she was stationed.  She sent pictures of the subpar condition of the hospital beds available to patients.  These images communicated the immediate need for better options for the people of this village.  Matt’s response was to organize a bike ride to raise funds to purchase new beds for the Maluti Aventist hospital.  He had already been plotting on a 100-mile ride through New Jersey’s most beautiful landscapes.  The route navigates cyclists along winding rivers, serene lakes and ponds; tidy vegetable farms, pine wood forests, refreshing bays, pastel painted seaside homes and finally the Atlantic Ocean.  Matt envisioned using this ride to Wildwood as a charity bike ride to raise funds for the Maluti Aventist hospital.  The bikers travel from quant Jersey towns through lush countryside to the salty sea air on quiet back roads and all the proceeds go towards a great cause.  This is how Bike4Beds got its start.  Eight years later, the initiative is still going strong; currently benefiting the students of the Cavaillon Orphanage in Southern Haiti.</font></p>
