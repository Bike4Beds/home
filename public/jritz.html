<p><b>Jessica Ritz - Chief Content Officer</b></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">Jessica participated in her first Bike4Beds event in the Fall of 2008.  It was a rousing adventure, watching friends and family break out of their comfort zones to bike further for the cause.  Although everyone contributed with different skills and abilities, each individual went the extra mile to make the day a success.  We were able to provide much needed beds for the patients at the Maluti Aventist Hospital (insert internal link to prior event page).The positive energy generated from that event radiated well beyond the finish line; keeping Jessica excited for the next opportunity to participate and give.  It wasn’t long before she realized that she wanted to help the Bike4Beds community grow and make a significant impact in more lives.</font></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">Despite studying Poetry at The University of Pittsburgh, Jessica went in a different direction after college with a job in IT Sales with 1&1 Internet.  As the CCO of Bike4Beds, she combines her growing knowledge of web hosting, SEO and online success with her love for creative writing.  Her long term goal is to communicate the unique story and vision of Bike4Beds to help the organization flourish.  Her short term goal is not to fall off of her bike at the Spring 2014 event.  She and Joe, the CFO, met in college and are now Bike4Beds’ sweethearts.  They live in the Greater Northeast of Philadelphia and enjoy playing slow pitch softball, going to see the Phighting Phils and trying out local microbreweries.  Jessica and the COO of Bike4Beds, Akoua Enow, are currently training for the Broad Street Run this May.</font></p>
