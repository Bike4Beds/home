<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">Komlan's journey to Bike4Beds started in 2009, when he visited his sister, Akoua, during her Peace Corps Mission in Lesotho.  He witnessed the dearth of patient beds at the Maluti Hospital that inspired the first B4B's 100 mile bike ride fundraiser. To honor Akoua's mission, Komlan published the weekly newsletters she composed during her mission. The memoir, <a href="http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/akoua-lonergan/the-mapheleng-sunrise/ebook/product-17397737.html"><font color="##0B610B"><u><b>The Mapheleng Sunrise</u></b></font></a>, is available on Lulu.com for your reading pleasure.</font></p></font></p
