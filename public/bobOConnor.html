<p><b>Bob O'Connor - Board Member</b></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">Bob O'Connor has been helping Bike4Beds since its inception in 2008.  He provides chase-car support for bikers who need timely sustenance and respite, a tire puncture repaired, vigorous moral encouragement, or a guiding light in the dark.  He also retrieves marker signs with a high rate of success - only one group of bikers lost during all our events!  And even they were eventually found!</font></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">Bob is a former Peace Corps Volunteer in Togo, West Africa, 1977-79 where he worked in rural development in the Animal Traction program --promoting harnessed cattle for cultivation and harvesting among subsistence-level farmers.  He graduated from the University of Massachusetts with a BA and from Columbia University with an MA.  He now works as an administrator at Barnard College, Columbia University.   He has been married to his lovely wife Magalie since 1986 and is the father of two grown sons.   He enjoys hot-air ballooning (see pic!) and is an aspiring Pacific Ocean cliff diver.</font></p>
