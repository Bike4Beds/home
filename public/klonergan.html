   <p>Komlan is the Chief Program Officer (CPO) for Bike4Beds. As CPO, he seeks to identify organizations with products or services that align with our core mission and values. He also initiates, manages, and fosters partnerships with these organizations.</p> 
<p><br />
Komlan's journey to Bike4Beds started in 2009, when he visited his sister, Akoua, during her Peace Corps Mission in Lesotho.  He witnessed the dearth of patient beds at the Maluti Hospital that inspired the first B4B's 100 mile bike ride fundraiser. To honor Akoua's mission, Komlan published the weekly newsletters she composed during her mission. The memoir, The Mapheleng Sunrise (insert link), is available on Lulu.com for your reading pleasure.</p>

Komlan holds a BA in Government from the College of William and Mary and  MS in Global Affairs from New  York University. His professional experience includes project management and capacity building for global 
NGOs.</p>
