<!-- 	<P>We created Bike4Beds as a way to make a difference to communities in need by hosting local bike rides in eastern PA and NJ. Each year we donate 100% of the money we raise. The past 6 years we have raised over $20,000 for our beneficiaries. This year we are sponsoring a computer science teacher and IT equipment for the students of the Cavaillon Orphanage of Southern Haiti. This orphanage is home to 25 girls ages 4 to 12. In the past 4 years we were able to donate over $15,000 dollars for other necessities for the students.  Bike with us on Sept. 9th and help us reach our goal of making a meaningful contribution to their education! This upcoming event includes a variety of scenic routes, ranging from 30 miles to a full century ride from eastern NJ down to Wildwood. This is a fun bike ride all the way from the countryside to the boardwalk; many of our friends and family return every year. Join us for a late summer tour of what the garden state has to offer cyclists of all ages and abilities. If you are busy Oct. 4th, be sure to check out our next Memorial Day Ride through Trexlertown and Kutztown, Pa.</P>

 	<P>Bike4Beds is able to make a positive impact thanks to the generosity of our donors, enthusiasm from our bike riders, and selfless assistance from our volunteers. We are deeply grateful to everyone who has helped us in the previous years in our efforts to assist the Cavaillon Orphanage, the Dispensaire de Hiheatro in Hiheatro, Togo and the Maluti Hospital in the Kingdom of Lesotho. Register to bike, sign up to volunteer, sponsor a biker or simply like us on Facebook and help us continue to support schools and hospitals, and dispensaries in communities across the world.</P> -->
