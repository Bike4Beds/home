<h5>My last visit to Togo was February 09, and I was very surprised by what I saw.  We visited the Dispensaire de Hiheatro (child birthing and first aid dispensary).  I could not believe what I saw, it was hard to imagine that some people have so much and others have almost nothing. The dispensaire was very run down but the staff was still able to take care of many people. The baby scale was destroyed, and they didnâ€™t even have a thermometer. I was so ashamed to see that patients shared bed pans. They also needed some beds and clean linens.  I talked to Matt when I came home and we quickly concluded that we should do a bike ride fundraiser to help the people at the dispensaire, back in my home country of Togo.  Please help us. Anything you can donate will be extremely useful to the people of Togo.<br /><br /><br />
Thank you very much,<br /><br />  Kossiwa Akakpo (Lonergan)</h5>
