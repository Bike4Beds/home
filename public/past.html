<h5>
My niece (Akoua) is a Peace Core Volunteer in Lesotho; her main objective is to combat the HIV/AIDS proliferation.  She works for the Maluti Aventist Hospital, which has a serious need for hospital beds. <br />
The hospital beds are foam mattresses with a plastic covering.  The plastic is torn or missing on a large majority of the beds allowing bodily fluid to seep into the foam.  Akoua's mother and father visited her this past winter and couldn’t believe how disgusting and unhealthy the situation actually is.  In a small effort to help the Maluti Hospital, we want to outfit the hospital with new sanitary beds.<br /><br />
We are biking 100 miles in an effort to raise money for the Maluti Aventist Hospital to purchase new beds.  If you are interested in donating or biking, please email bikeforbeds@gmail.com.  One Hundred Percent of all donations will go to the Maluti Aventist Hospital.<br /><br />
“With a shortage of trained personnel and medical supplies, Lesotho is severely afflicted by HIV/AIDS.  According to recent estimates, the prevalence is about 29%, one of the highest in the world.  The United Nations projects that this will rise to 36% within fifteen years, resulting in a sharp drop in life expectancy. According to the Lesotho Bureau of Statistics, in 2001 life expectancy was estimated at forty-eight years for men and fifty-six for women. Recent statistics estimate about thirty-seven years. Many children have lost parents. Traditionally lavish funerals leave survivors with another burden.”</h5>
