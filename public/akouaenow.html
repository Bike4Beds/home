<p><b>Akoua Enow - Cheif Operating Officer</b></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">Growing up, I always had a burning desire to live and work abroad in Africa. When I finished college, I applied for the Peace Corps Master’s International Program. For two semesters, I took graduate classes and in June 2007, I boarded my flight to Lesotho, Southern Africa to start my service. I sent emails to family and friends telling my experiences to maintain ties with home and fulfill the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/resources/returned/thirdgoal/"><font color="##0B610B"><u><b>the third goal of Peace Corps</u></b></font></a>. My stories and a visit from my parents and brother sparked a sense of community among my American and Basotho families. </font></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">My uncle approached me about raising money for Maluti Adventist Hospital, my host organization. He planned to host a bike ride and give 100% of the donations to the hospital. Matt asked me to collaborate with the hospital administration to identify a need. In partnership, we decided to buy adult and pediatric beds for the patients. And that’s how the organization got its name — Bike4Beds.</font></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">Now, I support the Bike4Beds as a “cyclist” and the Chief Operating Officer. The group rides are a great excuse to have fun while also fulfilling my passion to uplift humanity. Khotso, Pula, Nala!</font></p>
