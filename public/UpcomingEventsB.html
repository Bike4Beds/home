		Starting at 9:30am; this is our traditional ride. This route boasts of relatively flat scenic country roads where you are more likely to see a horse and buggy than an automobile. There is a rest stop at mile 15, where you will not only get water, gatoraid, snacks, and pizza, but also a complimentary beer at the Bowers Hotel.
