<p><b>Alarice Cesareo Lonergan - Cheif Marketing Officer</b></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">In her role as CMO, Alarice seeks to create awareness and support for Bike4Beds by promoting and advertising the achievements and benefits of the organization.</font></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">Alarice’s journey to Bike4Beds started at the early age of 5, but she didn’t know it then. Alarice could be found riding laps around the block on her hot pink and white Huffy bicycle with her friends and family (yes, you know you had one too, thought maybe not in pink). Her first ride for Bike4Beds was the year of the organization’s formation in 2010, alongside her friends and family. This first ride was especially important given we rode to support the hospital that her sister-in-law volunteered at in Lesotho. One of the most memorable rides was biking 50 miles through the Pennsylvania valley alongside her husband, and best friends on a treacherous ride up and down the hills and valleys. For Alarice, Bike4Beds has always been about the people she gets to share the road with and the people that each ride supports.</font></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">She is also an active member of
<a href="http://www.womeninamerica.net/"><font color="##0B610B"><u><b>W.O.M.E.N. in America</u></b></font></a>, a professional development group aimed at advancing promising professional women with exclusive mentoring, education and networking in a three year program. She looks forward to giving back to the community in her role as CMO of Bike4Beds.
