Drink up the seaside sights and smells as you tap your reserves for the final 10 miles into Wildwood.

		This route is ideal for experienced bikers who are interested in the full century ride through the width of New Jersey and down the coast into Wildwood.  This is the original route that we mapped out in an effort to take riders over quiet country roads with scenic views. This moderately flat course is a good course to do your first century. Riders should train for this route.  There are multiple rest stops with refreshing beverages and snacks.  We will stop at Wawa for lunch.  If you complete the full 100 miles, we will add your name to our new Century Club on the website!
