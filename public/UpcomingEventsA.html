   <H2 Align="Center">Saturday May 16th 2015</H2>

	<p> Please join us and help us celebrate our eighth year of biking and raising money.  This bike4beds event will raise funds for the Cavaillon Orphanage located in the town of Cavaillon in southern Haiti.  In previous years we have donated funds towards basic necessities for the girls; this year we hope to also promote their education.  100% of the funds raised by this event will go towards supporting the Cavaillon Orphanage along with hiring a teacher to help the children learn computer and problem solving skills.  </P>

	<p> We invite people of all ages and biking abilities to join us on a lively, sping bike ride.  We offer options for everyone!  Choose from six different routes ranging from 30 miles to the full century ride.  We start at Acme in Woodstown, NJ and ride through quiet towns and flat countryside on a scenic route towards the beach.  Explore tranquil pinewood forests, and ride past old, weathered farmhouses with wildflowers and vegetable stands in the front yard.  There are multiple rest stops at miles (16, 31.8, 46, 58, 82.5) with attendants, beverages, heath bars and homemade southwestern chicken wraps.  We stop midway at mile 58 for lunch at Wawa.  We also have volunteers and drivers to help with bikes and transportation along the way.  </p>

	<p>Come feel the refreshing sea breeze against your face as we ride into Avalon and down along the coast.  Sightsee the pastel cottages of Stone Harbor before crossing the bridge into Wildwood.  Finish up the day with the salty wind against your back as you ride down the boardwalk towards our final destination, The Fountain Motel.  Relax with a beer or Gatorade and good company during our post ride pizza party; before catching a ride back to the Acme in Woodstown, NJ.  Or, stay over and help us celebrate another successful bike ride to the shore! </P>
