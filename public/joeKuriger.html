<p><b>Joe Kuriger - Chief Financial Officer</b></p>

<p><font face='ariel' size="2.5">
Joe’s journey with Bike4Beds began in 2011 when he joined his girlfriend Jessi at a family charity event. Far from a biker, and let alone a cycling enthusiast, he had no idea how one ill-conceived attempt to ride 50 miles on a mountain bike would change his life. Not long after that fateful first ride, Joe was actively training for the bi-annual events and had even purchased his own street bike.

Beyond participation over the years, Joe learned a great deal about Bike4Beds; not only their story, but their mission to supply much needed humanitarian aid through the power of community-based events.

After the 2013 Fall Event, Joe decided to up his contribution to the cause, volunteering to take a position on the management team. Joe assumed the role of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) from Board member Jay Boyle. In his role he seeks to leverage his expertise to provide beneficiaries, stakeholders, donors, and the entire non-profit community full financial transparency into Bike4Beds.

When not working with Bike4Beds, Joe is a financial analyst for his company’s small business banking division. In addition to (now) being an avid cyclist, Joe enjoys playing golf and skiing. He lives in Cheltenham, PA with his girlfriend in the house they purchased together in 2013.
