	<p>Through group bike rides, Bike4Beds raises funds and gives 100% of the donations to empower partnered organizations of underprivileged communities.

	<h5>How do we give 100% donations to the cause?</h5>
	We believe in volunteerism. Excellent talent that can be harnessed by people who want to share this talent towards causes they believe in. We don’t have any salaried employees. However, we still accrue costs like paying to host this site.</p>

	<p>
	We break our donations down into two categories (Restricted and Unrestricted).  All donations are categorized as restricted except for biking event fees (this amount is noted during the sign-up process), and Bike4Bed board member gifts.

	1)	Restricted – All donations are categorized as restricted except for those deemed unrestricted. 100% of these funds go directly to the cause.

	2)	Unrestricted - Biking event fees (this amount is noted during the sign-up process), and Bike4Bed board member gifts. These pay for the event costs, and operating costs.
