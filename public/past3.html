<h2>A note from Sr Diane Beaudoin:</h2><br /><br />
<h4>We opened our orphanage for little girls in December 2008. The first two little girls who arrived, GisËle and Fafan, came from a city about three hours drive from Cavaillon where the orphanage is located. Fafan was three years old and GisËle was four. Leaving their homes and their families to find themselves with strangers was not easy, but once they arrived they seemed to adjust well. A few weeks after their arrival, the sister and the driver who had brought them to the orphanage arrived for a visit. When  Fafan and GisËle saw them they both went to hide. When at last they were found and asked why they were hiding, they both said they were afraid that
the man and the sister had come to take them back home, and they did not want to leave the orphanage. Here they have food everyday, lots of other little girls to play with, toys to play with and loving adults to care for them. For the first months that they were there every time the sister and the driver came, they would hide until they finally realized that no one was going to take them away from the orphanage.<br /><br />
One of the first places the little girls would take visitors to the orphanage, was to their bedrooms to show them their beds. They would then proceed to tell the visitors that they each had a bed to sleep in. For most of these little girls it was the first time they slept in a bed.<br /><br />
When Fafan came to the orphanage at age three, she was suffering from malnutrition. One of the effects of malnutrition caused her black hair to turn reddish and her hair just would not grow. The other girls would call her a boy because of her very short hair. This made Fafan very unhappy, the more so because all the other girls had braids and bright ribbons in their hair and she did not. It took a while before we figured out what was making her so unhappy. So Mama Maggie would take the inch long hair and twist it as much as she could and attached a bright ribbon to her hair. Fafan was so happy, she refound her good humor and found new confidence in herself and she began to blossom. Today, two years later she is a happy child with a ready smile and loving personality.</h4>
