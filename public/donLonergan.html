Don, who has never shied away from a good time pursued a volunteer position in the Peace Corps. Embracing the Corp's mantra, Don's cup was always more than half full (of beer). After a 2 year stint building schools and dispensaries in Togo, West Africa he set out on an extended sojourn through Central and East Africa and ultimately ending up in Cape Town at the southern tip of Africa working as a Landscape Architect. Unable to cope with the inequities of life under the Apartheid law he returned home to the U.S. to begin a family with his Togolese sweetheart, Kossiwa. Kossiwa emigrated to the U.S. in 1982 with their son Komlan. Two years later a daughter, Akoua, joined the mix completing the quintessential American family with its strong African roots. In 1986, with some strong Lonergan family support, Don started his own design/build landscape construction business. Now, 28 successful years later Lehigh Valley Landscape is still transforming landscapes throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Don enjoys traveling, visiting friends and family members, playing volleyball, brewing beer, and flying over the Sahara Dessert on Google Earth.
