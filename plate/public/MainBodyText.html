We will be sponsoring the Cavaillon Orphanage in Haiti.  The orphanage was opened on December 8, 2008 in Cavaillon, a town located in the south of Haiti. The orphanage is owned and operated by the Sisters of Charity of Saint-Hyacinthe. There are about 25 young girls presently there, from the ages of 4 to about 12. All the girls attend either the nursery or elementary school operated by the Sisters. Funding for the orphanage is through donations.</P>
 
	<P>This will be our fifth year of fund raising.  Our mission is to help people and their communities that are in the poorest of third world countries.  Our help is focused on small community hospitals/ dispensaries and orphanages. In 2008 we purchased 43 hospital beds plus linens for the Maluti Hospital in the Kingdom of Lesotho.  IN 2009 we purchased supplies for the Dispensaire de Hiheatro in Hiheatro, Togo. And last year we donated money to help the Cavaillon Orphanage in Haiti.</P>
